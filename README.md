# roamie
Roamie is a plugin that can sync your local Miranda database with a remote one. It compresses and encrypts a database for you and uploads it to a provided ftp location. Next time, on another computer, it can download it for you, decrypt, decompress and load so you can have all your history, contacts & settings with you.
